Hello there. This is the readme.txt file that was created from a local computer and then added to the hello-world repository
on Git Hub. 

This was added. I will then sync and hope that it all works out.
Remember: 
- A SOLUTION consists of a set of PROJECTS
- A PROJECT consists of one or more files
